* TI Highspeed MMC host controller for OMAP

The Highspeed MMC Host Controller on TI OMAP family
provides an interface for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the omap_hsmmc driver.

>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
Required properties:
- compatible:
 Should be "ti,omap2-hsmmc", for OMAP2 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap3-hsmmc", for OMAP3 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap4-hsmmc", for OMAP4 controllers
- ti,hwmods: Must be "mmc<n>", n is controller instance starting 1
<<<<<<< HEAD
- reg : should contain hsmmc registers location and length
=======
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master

Optional properties:
ti,dual-volt: boolean, supports dual voltage cards
<supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
"supply-name" examples are "vmmc", "vmmc_aux" etc
<<<<<<< HEAD
ti,bus-width: Number of data lines, default assumed is 1 if the property is missing.
cd-gpios: GPIOs for card detection
wp-gpios: GPIOs for write protection
ti,non-removable: non-removable slot (like eMMC)
ti,needs-special-reset: Requires a special softreset sequence

Example:
=======
ti,non-removable: non-removable slot (like eMMC)
ti,needs-special-reset: Requires a special softreset sequence
ti,needs-special-hs-handling: HSMMC IP needs special setting for handling High Speed
dmas: List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format
as described in the generic DMA client binding. A tx and rx
specifier is required.
dma-names: List of DMA request names. These strings correspond
1:1 with the DMA specifiers listed in dmas. The string naming is
to be "rx" and "tx" for RX and TX DMA requests, respectively.

Examples:

[hwmod populated DMA resources]

	mmc1: mmc@0x4809c000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-hsmmc";
		reg = <0x4809c000 0x400>;
		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		ti,dual-volt;
		bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
	};

[generic DMA request binding]

		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		ti,dual-volt;
<<<<<<< HEAD
		ti,bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
=======

		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
