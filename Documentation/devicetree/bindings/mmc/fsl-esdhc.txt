* Freescale Enhanced Secure Digital Host Controller (eSDHC)

The Enhanced Secure Digital Host Controller provides an interface
for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Required properties:
  - compatible : should be
    "fsl,<chip>-esdhc", "fsl,esdhc"
  - reg : should contain eSDHC registers location and length.
  - interrupts : should contain eSDHC interrupt.
  - interrupt-parent : interrupt source phandle.
  - clock-frequency : specifies eSDHC base clock frequency.
  - sdhci,wp-inverted : (optional) specifies that eSDHC controller
    reports inverted write-protect state;
  - sdhci,1-bit-only : (optional) specifies that a controller can
    only handle 1-bit data transfers.
  - sdhci,auto-cmd12: (optional) specifies that a controller can
    only handle auto CMD12.
=======
This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the sdhci-esdhc driver.

Required properties:
  - interrupt-parent : interrupt source phandle.
  - clock-frequency : specifies eSDHC base clock frequency.

Optional properties:
  - sdhci,wp-inverted : specifies that eSDHC controller reports
    inverted write-protect state; New devices should use the generic
    "wp-inverted" property.
  - sdhci,1-bit-only : specifies that a controller can only handle
    1-bit data transfers. New devices should use the generic
    "bus-width = <1>" property.
  - sdhci,auto-cmd12: specifies that a controller can only handle auto
    CMD12.
  - voltage-ranges : two cells are required, first cell specifies minimum
    slot voltage (mV), second cell specifies maximum slot voltage (mV).
    Several ranges could be specified.

	interrupts = <42 0x8>;
	interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
	/* Filled in by U-Boot */
