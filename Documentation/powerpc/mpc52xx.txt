Some remarks :
 - The port is named mpc52xxx, and config options are PPC_MPC52xx. The MGT5100
   is not supported, and I'm not sure anyone is interesting in working on it
   so. I didn't took 5xxx because there's apparently a lot of 5xxx that have
   nothing to do with the MPC5200. I also included the 'MPC' for the same
   reason.
 - Of course, I inspired myself from the 2.4 port. If you think I forgot to
   mention you/your company in the copyright of some code, I'll correct it
   ASAP.
