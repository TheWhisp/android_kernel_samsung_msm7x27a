Description:

Being used for adding and removing rbd block devices.

Usage: <mon ip addr> <options> <pool name> <rbd image name> [snap name]

 $ echo "192.168.0.1 name=admin rbd foo" > /sys/bus/rbd/add

The snapshot name can be "-" or omitted to map the image read/write. A <dev-id>
will be assigned for any registered block device. If snapshot is used, it will
be mapped read-only.

Removal of a device:

  $ echo <dev-id> > /sys/bus/rbd/remove

Entries under /sys/bus/rbd/devices/<dev-id>/

major

	The block device major number.

name

<<<<<<< HEAD
pool

	The pool where this rbd image resides. The pool-name pair is unique
	per rados system.
=======
image_id

	The unique id for the rbd image.  (For rbd image format 1
	this is empty.)

pool

	The name of the storage pool where this rbd image resides.
	An rbd image name is unique within its pool.

pool_id

size

	The size (in bytes) of the mapped block device.

refresh

create_snap

	Create a snapshot:

	 $ echo <snap-name> > /sys/bus/rbd/devices/<dev-id>/snap_create

rollback_snap

	Rolls back data to the specified snapshot. This goes over the entire
	list of rados blocks and sends a rollback command to each.

	 $ echo <snap-name> > /sys/bus/rbd/devices/<dev-id>/snap_rollback
