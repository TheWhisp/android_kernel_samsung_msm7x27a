Introduction
------------

  SPEAr (Structured Processor Enhanced Architecture).
  weblink : http://www.st.com/spear

  The ST Microelectronics SPEAr range of ARM9/CortexA9 System-on-Chip CPUs are
<<<<<<< HEAD
  supported by the 'spear' platform of ARM Linux. Currently SPEAr300,
  SPEAr310, SPEAr320 and SPEAr600 SOCs are supported. Support for the SPEAr13XX
  series is in progress.

  supported by the 'spear' platform of ARM Linux. Currently SPEAr1310,
  SPEAr1340, SPEAr300, SPEAr310, SPEAr320 and SPEAr600 SOCs are supported.

  Hierarchy in SPEAr is as follows:

  SPEAr (Platform)
	- SPEAr3XX (3XX SOC series, based on ARM9)
		- SPEAr300 (SOC)
<<<<<<< HEAD
			- SPEAr300_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr310 (SOC)
			- SPEAr310_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr320 (SOC)
			- SPEAr320_EVB (Evaluation Board)
	- SPEAr6XX (6XX SOC series, based on ARM9)
		- SPEAr600 (SOC)
			- SPEAr600_EVB (Evaluation Board)
	- SPEAr13XX (13XX SOC series, based on ARM CORTEXA9)
		- SPEAr1300 (SOC)

  Configuration
  -------------

  A generic configuration is provided for each machine, and can be used as the
  default by
<<<<<<< HEAD
	make spear600_defconfig
	make spear300_defconfig
	make spear310_defconfig
	make spear320_defconfig
=======
	make spear13xx_defconfig
	make spear3xx_defconfig
	make spear6xx_defconfig
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master

  Layout
  ------

<<<<<<< HEAD
  The common files for multiple machine families (SPEAr3XX, SPEAr6XX and
  SPEAr13XX) are located in the platform code contained in arch/arm/plat-spear
=======
  The common files for multiple machine families (SPEAr3xx, SPEAr6xx and
  SPEAr13xx) are located in the platform code contained in arch/arm/plat-spear
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
  with headers in plat/.

  Each machine series have a directory with name arch/arm/mach-spear followed by
  series name. Like mach-spear3xx, mach-spear6xx and mach-spear13xx.

<<<<<<< HEAD
  Common file for machines of spear3xx family is mach-spear3xx/spear3xx.c and for
  spear6xx is mach-spear6xx/spear6xx.c. mach-spear* also contain soc/machine
  specific files, like spear300.c, spear310.c, spear320.c and spear600.c.
  mach-spear* also contains board specific files for each machine type.
=======
  Common file for machines of spear3xx family is mach-spear3xx/spear3xx.c, for
  spear6xx is mach-spear6xx/spear6xx.c and for spear13xx family is
  mach-spear13xx/spear13xx.c. mach-spear* also contain soc/machine specific
  files, like spear1310.c, spear1340.c spear300.c, spear310.c, spear320.c and
  spear600.c.  mach-spear* doesn't contains board specific files as they fully
  support Flattened Device Tree.
