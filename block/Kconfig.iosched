config IOSCHED_NOOP
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  The no-op I/O scheduler is a minimal scheduler that does basic merging
	  and sorting. Its main uses include non-disk based block devices like
	  memory devices, and specialised software or hardware environments
	  that do their own scheduling and require only minimal assistance from
	  the kernel.

config IOSCHED_TEST
	tristate "Test I/O scheduler"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	default m
	---help---
	  The test I/O scheduler is a duplicate of the noop scheduler with
	  addition of test utlity.
	  It allows testing a block device by dispatching specific requests
	  according to the test case and declare PASS/FAIL according to the
	  requests completion error code.

config IOSCHED_DEADLINE
	tristate "Deadline I/O scheduler"
	default y
	---help---
	  The deadline I/O scheduler is simple and compact. It will provide
	  CSCAN service with FIFO expiration of requests, switching to
	  a new point in the service tree and doing a batch of IO from there
	  in case of expiry.

config IOSCHED_ROW
	tristate "ROW I/O scheduler"
	default y
	---help---
	  The ROW I/O scheduler gives priority to READ requests over the
	  WRITE requests when dispatching, without starving WRITE requests.
	  Requests are kept in priority queues. Dispatching is done in a RR
	  manner when the dispatch quantum for each queue is calculated
	  according to queue priority.
	  Most suitable for mobile devices.

config IOSCHED_CFQ

>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
	default y
	---help---
	  The CFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth equally
	  among all processes in the system. It should provide a fair
	  and low latency working environment, suitable for both desktop
	  and server systems.

	  This is the default I/O scheduler.

	  The BFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth among

	  It aims at distributing the bandwidth as desired, independently of
	  the disk parameters and with any workload. It also tries to

	  be configured to support hierarchical scheduling.
