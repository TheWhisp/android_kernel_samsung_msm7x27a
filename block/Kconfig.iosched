config IOSCHED_NOOP
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  The no-op I/O scheduler is a minimal scheduler that does basic merging
	  and sorting. Its main uses include non-disk based block devices like
	  memory devices, and specialised software or hardware environments
	  that do their own scheduling and require only minimal assistance from
	  the kernel.

config IOSCHED_TEST
	tristate "Test I/O scheduler"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	default m
	---help---
	  The test I/O scheduler is a duplicate of the noop scheduler with
	  addition of test utlity.
	  It allows testing a block device by dispatching specific requests
	  according to the test case and declare PASS/FAIL according to the
	  requests completion error code.

config IOSCHED_DEADLINE
	tristate "Deadline I/O scheduler"
	default y
	---help---
	  The deadline I/O scheduler is simple and compact. It will provide
	  CSCAN service with FIFO expiration of requests, switching to
	  a new point in the service tree and doing a batch of IO from there
	  in case of expiry.

config IOSCHED_ROW
	tristate "ROW I/O scheduler"
	default y
	---help---
	  The ROW I/O scheduler gives priority to READ requests over the
	  WRITE requests when dispatching, without starving WRITE requests.
	  Requests are kept in priority queues. Dispatching is done in a RR
	  manner when the dispatch quantum for each queue is calculated
	  according to queue priority.
	  Most suitable for mobile devices.

config IOSCHED_CFQ

	default y
	---help---
	  The CFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth equally
	  among all processes in the system. It should provide a fair
	  and low latency working environment, suitable for both desktop
	  and server systems.

	  This is the default I/O scheduler.

	  It aims at distributing the bandwidth as desired, independently of

	  be configured to support hierarchical scheduling.
