	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruption.

	  For architectures which don't enable ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC,
	  fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
	  the patterns before alloc_pages().  Additionally,
	  this option cannot be enabled in combination with hibernation as
	  that would result in incorrect warnings of memory corruption after
	  a resume because free pages are not saved to the suspend image.
