	  Support for Transformation(XFRM) user configuration interface
	  like IPsec used by native Linux tools.

	  Support sub policy for developers. By using sub policy with main
	  one, two policies can be applied to the same packet at once.
	  Policy which lives shorter time in kernel should be a sub.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  A feature to update locator(s) of a given IPsec security
	  association dynamically.  This feature is required, for
	  instance, in a Mobile IPv6 environment with IPsec configuration
	  where mobile nodes change their attachment point to the Internet.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  PF_KEYv2 socket family, compatible to KAME ones.
	  They are required if you are going to use IPsec tools ported
	  from KAME.

	  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

	  Add a PF_KEY MIGRATE message to PF_KEYv2 socket family.
	  The PF_KEY MIGRATE message is used to dynamically update
	  locator(s) of a given IPsec security association.
	  This feature is required, for instance, in a Mobile IPv6
	  environment with IPsec configuration where mobile nodes
	  change their attachment point to the Internet.  Detail
	  information can be found in the internet-draft
	  <draft-sugimoto-mip6-pfkey-migrate>.

	  If unsure, say N.
