	  If you say Y here, you will be able to mount Macintosh-formatted
	  floppy disks and hard drive partitions with full read-write access.
	  Please read <file:Documentation/filesystems/hfs.txt> to learn about
	  the available mount options.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hfs.
