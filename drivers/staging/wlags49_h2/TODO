adding support for Hermes II and Hermes II.5 cards to the existing orinoco
driver. The orinoco driver currently only supports Hermes I based cards.
Since this will not happen by magic and has not happened until now this
driver provides a stop-gap solution for these type of cards.

Having said that, the following wishlist comes to mind to make the driver
suitable as fully supported kernel driver. Feel free to expand/enhance the
list.

TODO:
	- verify against a Hermes II.5 card
<<<<<<< HEAD
	- verify with WPA encription (both with H2 and H2.5 cards)
	- sometimes the card does not initialize correctly, retry mechanisms
	  are build in to catch most cases but not all
	- once the driver runs it is very stable, but I have the impression
	  some the crittical sections take to long

	- the driver is split into a Hermes II and a Hermes II.5 part, it
	  would be nice to handle both with one module instead of two
	- review by the wireless developer community
	- verify the code against the coding standards for a proper linux
	  driver
	- resolve license issues (?)

DONE:
	- verified against a Hermes II card (Thomson Speedtouch 110 PCMCIA
	  card)

	- verified with WEP encription

Please send any patches or complaints about this driver to Greg
Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and Cc: Henk de Groot <pe1dnn@amsat.org>
Don't bother the upstream wireless kernel developers about it, they
want nothing to do with it.
