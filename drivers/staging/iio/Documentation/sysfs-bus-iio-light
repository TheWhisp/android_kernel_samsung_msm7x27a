Description:
		Hardware dependent mode for an ALS device to calculate the value
		in proximity mode. When this is enabled, then the device should
		use a infrared sensor reading to remove infrared noise from the
		proximity reading. If this is not enabled, the driver can still
		do this calculation manually by reading the infrared sensor
		value and doing the negation in sw.

Description:
		This property is supported by proximity sensors and should be
		used to return the value of a reading by the sensor. If this
		value is returned in SI units, it should also include _input

Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This property is supported by sensors that have an infrared
		sensing mode. This value should be the output from a reading
		and if expressed in SI units, should include _input. If this
		value is not in SI units, then it should include _raw.

Description:
		This property is supported by sensors that have a RGBC
