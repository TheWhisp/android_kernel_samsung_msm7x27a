	  zsmalloc is a slab-based memory allocator designed to store
	  compressed RAM pages.  zsmalloc uses virtual memory mapping
	  in order to reduce fragmentation.  However, this results in a
	  non-standard allocator interface where a handle, not a pointer, is
	  returned by an alloc().  This handle must be mapped in order to
	  access the allocated space.

	bool "Use page table mapping to access object in zsmalloc"
	depends on ZSMALLOC
	help
	  By default, zsmalloc uses a copy-based object mapping method to
	  access allocations that span two pages. However, if a particular
	  architecture (ex, ARM) performs VM mapping faster than copying,
	  then you should select this. This causes zsmalloc to use page table
	  mapping rather than copying for object mapping.

	  You can check speed with zsmalloc benchmark[1].
