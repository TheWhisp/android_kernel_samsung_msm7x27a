Note, the powermanagement options were removed from the vendor provided
driver as they did not build properly at the time.

TODO:

	- kernel coding style cleanups
	- forward port for latest network driver changes
	- kill useless typecasts (e.g. in et1310_phy.c)
	- alloc_etherdev is initializing memory with zero?!?
	- add_timer call in et131x_netdev.c is correct?
	- Add power saving functionality (suspend, sleep, resume)
	- Implement a few more kernel Parameter (set mac )

Please send patches to:
	Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

And Cc: Olaf Hartmann <o.hartmann@telovital.com> as he has this device and can
test any changes.
=======
	- Use of kmem_cache seems a bit unusual
=======
	- Look at reducing the number of spinlocks
	- Simplify code in nic_rx_pkts(), when determining multicast_pkts_rcvd
	- Implement NAPI support
	- In et131x_tx(), don't return NETDEV_TX_BUSY, just drop the packet with kfree_skb().
	- Reduce the number of split lines by careful consideration of variable names etc.
